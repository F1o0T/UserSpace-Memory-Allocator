# UserSpace-Memory-Allocator (StudyProject)
This project is an education project that we built to understand how the memory allocation in the computer systems works. 

### The implemented compnents are the following: 
1. BSSHeap and FirstFit heaps as Runtime Allocators
2. Virtual Memory Subsystem that uses FIFO and LRU replacement stratagies. 


### Compilation and Execution
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xreinheitx/UserSpace-Memory-Allocator
cd UserSpace-Memory-Allocator
make clean && make && ./main
```
